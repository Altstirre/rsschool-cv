## About Myself:
>My name is Dmitry. I am a musician. The main direction of music is heavy metal.

>In my life I have tried many professions:
Office, bars, restaurants, factories, warehouse and even a cleaner. None of this could interest me enough to devote all my free time to it. Until my life turned upside down, and I decided to try you in the IT field.

>This is very interesting and exciting, I really want to understand this.

>At the moment I am studying at the Rolling Scopes School as a JS / FRONT-END developer, and only learn the basics of layout and languages like HTML 5, CSS 3 and JS.

>I hope my perseverance and thirst for learning something new and interesting will be enough to learn and master this profession and enter the IT world.
